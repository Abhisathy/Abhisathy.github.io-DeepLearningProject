# Deep Learning - Computer Vision Project Report

* Recognized and located IKEA products in "IKEA gallery images" using deep neural network models by training the model on the images in my annotated IKEA dataset.
* Trained YOLO neural net model with our dataset to generate a custom network to detect additional objects in my images.
